# scratch-quiz
This is a simple general knowledge quiz game built with Scratch, featuring dynamic Q&A using lists, score tracking, character animations, and custom blocks. It demonstrates core programming concepts like loops, variables, and conditionals.

This project was created as part of my application for a CS50 community job.
